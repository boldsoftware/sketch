# What is Sketch?

Sketch is a coding agent.

It runs as a standalone process or as part of a cloud service integrated with GitHub. Sketch uses
a custom web-based user interface, because agent workflows are too complex for the terminal and
far different from the traditional IDE.

## What should I ask it to do?

One of the hardest parts about using a coding agent is knowing where to start. You open it up and
there is a blank text box. What do you type? Here are some ideas:

- `What does this program do?`
- `Find a function that does not have a unit test and should. Write the test.`
- `Fix https://github.com/yourname/yourproject/issues/N`
